So In this  question we have to calculate the maximum amount of Water that can be filled in the countainer given the bars of height h.
In order to solve this question we first make two pointers pointing to the left(a) and the right(b) of the array/vector.
Then we move the pointers in such a way that the a is always < b till they cross each other .
Then we take the maximum area of the countainer at that point in time with the smaller area * (b-a);
And in the other condition we take other condition that is if height of a less then b.

Here is the code for the problem:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int area=0;
       int  a=0;
      int   b=height.size()-1;
        if(height.size()==0 || height.size()==1)return 0;
        while(a<b){
            if(height[a]>=height[b]){
                area=max(area,height[b]*(b-a));
                b--;
            }else if(height[a]<height[b]){
                area=max(area,height[a]*(b-a));
                a++;
            }
        }
        return area;
    }
};
